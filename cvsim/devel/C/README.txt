The C/ directory contains the C code for the hemodynamic simulation,
the GUI backend. The 6-comp-backend/ directory contains the code for a
6-compartment hemodynamic model. The 6-compartment model is described
in detail in "Teaching Physiology Through Interactive Simulation of
Hemodynamics", a Masters thesis by Timothy Davis [1].  The
21-comp-backend/ directory contains the code for a 21-compartment
hemodynamic model. The 21-compartment model is described in detail in
"Computational Models of Cardiovascular Response to Orthostatic
Stress", a PhD thesis by Dr. Thomas Heldt [2]. All the code in the C/
directory was written by Dr. Thomas Heldt, with minor modifications by
Catherine Dunn where noted to allow the C code to interface with the
Java code.
