Version *1.0* is the old stable version released in 2008. It requires Java 1.6 or 1.7.

From version *1.0.1* (released in Jan 2018) onwards, the `cvsim-x.y.z-platform.tar.gz` archives are created by archiving the `devel/java/classes/` subdirectory, after compiling the same version's code on the relevant platform, and renaming the folder. The `README.txt` files in each tar distribution contain compilation information.


# Changelog Overview

- Version *1.0.1* added by Chen Jan 2018. Fixed array out of bounds in `turning.c`. Distributions compiled using Java 1.8.
