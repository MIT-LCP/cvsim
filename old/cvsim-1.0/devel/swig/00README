CVSIM SWIG README

This directory contains the SWIG interface files for the CVSIM
GUI. SWIG, Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator, is an open-source
tool for generating C/C++ bindings (wrappers) for high-level
programming languages. In this case, SWIG was used to generate Java
wrappers and a shared object library for the CVSIM model. The wrapper
files generated by SWIG connect the Java GUI code to the underlying C
model.

The Java wrappers rely on the Java Native Interface (JNI), a programming
framework that allows Java code running in the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) to use libraries written in other languages.
